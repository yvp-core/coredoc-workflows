# Security Specialist Review Checklist

Selection and blocking: the resolved Review policy decides both; treat this
checklist as evidence guidance, not a policy override.
Output: use the canonical JSON schema supplied by dispatch, with
`category` and `specialist` set to `security`.
If no findings: output `NO FINDINGS` and nothing else.

Apply the shared finding contract. A security candidate needs a concrete reachable
trust-boundary or exploit path; identify defense-in-depth ideas without one as
factual uncertainty rather than assigning a severity floor.

The main agent already checks injection, reachable races, LLM trust boundaries,
and enum completeness. Focus this pass on auth/authz patterns, cryptographic
misuse, and demonstrated attack-surface expansion.

## Categories

### Input Validation at Trust Boundaries
- User input accepted without validation at controller/handler level
- Query parameters used directly in database queries or file paths
- Request body fields accepted without type checking or schema validation
- File uploads without type/size/content validation
- Webhook payloads processed without signature verification

### Auth & Authorization Bypass
- Endpoints missing authentication middleware (check route definitions)
- Authorization checks that default to "allow" instead of "deny"
- Role escalation paths (user can modify their own role/permissions)
- Direct object reference vulnerabilities (user A accesses user B's data by changing an ID)
- Session fixation or session hijacking opportunities
- Token/API key validation that doesn't check expiration

### Injection Vectors (beyond SQL)
- Command injection via subprocess calls with user-controlled arguments
- Template injection (Jinja2, ERB, Handlebars) with user input
- LDAP injection in directory queries
- SSRF via user-controlled URLs (fetch, redirect, webhook targets)
- Path traversal via user-controlled file paths (../../etc/passwd)
- Header injection via user-controlled values in HTTP headers

### Cryptographic Misuse
- Weak hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA1) for security-sensitive operations
- Predictable randomness (Math.random, rand()) for tokens or secrets
- Non-constant-time comparisons (==) on secrets, tokens, or digests
- Hardcoded encryption keys or IVs
- Missing salt in password hashing

### Secrets Exposure
- API keys, tokens, or passwords in source code (even in comments)
- Secrets logged in application logs or error messages
- Credentials in URLs (query parameters or basic auth in URL)
- Sensitive data in error responses returned to users
- PII stored in plaintext when encryption is expected

### XSS via Escape Hatches
- Rails: .html_safe, raw() on user-controlled data
- React: dangerouslySetInnerHTML with user content
- Vue: v-html with user content
- Django: |safe, mark_safe() on user input
- General: innerHTML assignment with unsanitized data

### Deserialization
- Deserializing untrusted data (pickle, Marshal, YAML.load, JSON.parse of executable types)
- Accepting serialized objects from user input or external APIs without schema validation
